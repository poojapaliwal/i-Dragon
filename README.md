# i-Dragon
Introduction: 
This game is purely made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript with turtle and dragon.
To Play this game, we just need to follow some steps:

About this project: 
turtle in this game wants to be safe from dragon so we are here to help this turtle if dragon attacks on it. 
we can use up key to jump turtle, to shift it to the right and left we can use right and left key in keyboard. 
Background sound will also be available when we are playing and it stops when turtle collides with dragon the sound stops and we lose the game 
This is how we maintain turtle's position and will help it. 

contribution:
we can add new features and more tortoise to make this game more interesting so everyone can contribute to this project with some new ideas and valid changes.
